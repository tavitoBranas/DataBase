# First assignment for Base de datos 1 (Second semester at ORT University)
In here I share my final task for this subjet. I present the Entity Relationship Diagram Model based on the requirements, the identification of primary, foreign keys 
and the 3NF relational schema. I also present the SQL solution with test data pre loaded and the different search made.
